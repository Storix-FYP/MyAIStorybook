# MyAIStorybook System Diagrams

This folder contains comprehensive UML and DFD diagrams for the MyAIStorybook system, created according to software engineering best practices and the guidelines provided in the `diagram_documentation` folder.

## 📁 Available Formats

- **PlantUML (.puml)**: All diagrams in this folder - best for detailed documentation and print quality
