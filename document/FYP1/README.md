## 🔧 How to Compile

### Prerequisites
- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
- `pdflatex` compiler
- `bibtex` for bibliography

### Compilation Steps

```bash
# Navigate to the FYP1 directory
cd document/FYP1

# First pass - generates aux files
pdflatex thesis.tex

# Process bibliography
bibtex thesis

# Second pass - includes bibliography
pdflatex thesis.tex

# Third pass - finalizes cross-references
pdflatex thesis.tex
```

### Quick Compile (Windows)
```bash
# Create a batch file: compile.bat
@echo off
pdflatex thesis.tex
bibtex thesis
pdflatex thesis.tex
pdflatex thesis.tex
echo Compilation complete! Check thesis.pdf
pause
```

### Quick Compile (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Create a shell script: compile.sh
#!/bin/bash
pdflatex thesis.tex
bibtex thesis.tex
pdflatex thesis.tex
pdflatex thesis.tex
echo "Compilation complete! Check thesis.pdf"
```

## 📊 Adding Diagrams

### Recommended Tools
- **Draw.io / diagrams.net:** For general diagrams (free, web-based)
- **PlantUML:** For UML diagrams (integrates well with LaTeX)
- **TikZ:** For LaTeX-native diagrams (best quality)
- **Lucidchart:** For professional diagrams (paid)
- **Mermaid to Image:** Convert existing Mermaid diagram to PNG/PDF

### Adding a Diagram to LaTeX

1. **Create your diagram** in your preferred tool
2. **Export as PDF or PNG** (PDF preferred for quality)
3. **Save in ThesisFigs/** directory
4. **Replace the placeholder** in the .tex file:

```latex
% Remove this:
\vspace{3cm}
\begin{center}
\textit{[Diagram description here]}
\end{center}
\vspace{2cm}

% Add this instead:
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ThesisFigs/your_diagram.pdf}
\caption{Your Diagram Title}
\label{fig:your-diagram}
\end{figure}
```

### Converting Architecture Diagram from Mermaid

The architecture diagram source is in: `diagrams/architecture_diagram/architecture_diagram.mmd`

**Option 1: Online Converter**
1. Copy the Mermaid code
2. Go to https://mermaid.live/
3. Paste and edit if needed
4. Export as PNG or SVG
5. Save to ThesisFigs/architecture_diagram.png

**Option 2: CLI Tool**
```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i architecture_diagram.mmd -o architecture_diagram.pdf
```

## 📚 Bibliography Management

The bibliography is in `bib.bib`. All references are already added and properly formatted.

### Current References (16 total)
- Ollama, Stable Diffusion, IP-Adapter
- LangChain, FastAPI, React
- PyTorch, Diffusers, Transformers
- Whisper, Coqui TTS
- Pydantic, ReportLab
- Academic papers (Vaswani et al., Rombach et al., Touvron et al.)

### Adding New References
```bibtex
@Article{author2024,
  Title                    = {Paper Title},
  Author                   = {Author Name},
  Journal                  = {Journal Name},
  Year                     = {2024},
  Pages                    = {1--10},
  Volume                   = {5}
}
```

Then cite in text: `\cite{author2024}`

## 🎨 Customization

### Student Information
Already updated in `thesis.tex` lines 18-34:
- Names and registration numbers
- Supervisor name

Your abstract here (150-200 words)
\end{abstract}
```

### Adding Acknowledgements
Uncomment in `thesis.tex` (lines 41-43):
```latex
\begin{acknowledgements}
Your acknowledgments here
\end{acknowledgements}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "fast-nuces-bs.cls not found"  
**Solution:** Ensure you're compiling from the FYP1 directory where the .cls file is located.

**Issue:** "Bibliography not showing"  
**Solution:** Run the complete compilation sequence (pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex → pdflatex).

**Issue:** "Figures not displaying"  
**Solution:** Check that image files are in ThesisFigs/ and paths are correct.

**Issue:** "Undefined references"  
**Solution:** Run pdflatex multiple times (at least twice) to resolve cross-references.

**Issue:** "Font warnings"  
**Solution:** The document uses Times Roman font (mathptmx package). Ensure your LaTeX distribution has complete font support.

## 📖 Writing Guidelines

All content follows these principles:
- **Professional Academic Tone:** Suitable for university evaluation
- **Technical Accuracy:** Reflects actual implementation
- **Comprehensive Detail:** Thorough explanations for all components
- **Proper Citations:** All technologies and concepts properly referenced
- **Consistent Terminology:** Same terms used throughout
- **Clear Organization:** Logical flow from introduction to conclusion

## 📞 Support

For questions about:
- **LaTeX compilation:** Check your TeX distribution documentation
- **Content accuracy:** Review memory-bank files and .cursorrules
- **Project implementation:** Check backend and frontend code
- **Academic requirements:** Consult with supervisor (Mr. Muhammad Aamir Gulzar)
